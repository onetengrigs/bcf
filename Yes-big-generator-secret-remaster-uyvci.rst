 · Big Generator, this was a tough one for me, between the US IFPI RE (Secret Remaster) and my Alsdorf German SRC I gave both a good listen after giving them a break for a few months, and as @Futurecity put up a good fight against the RE I'm going to agree with him, my Alsdorf trumps it no doubt.  · Style: Art Rock, Pop Rock, Soft Rock. Year: Notes: Big Generator is the twelfth studio album by progressive rock band Yes. It was released in on Atlantic Records’ Atco subsidiary label (Yes’ last studio album for Atlantic) and was the follow-up to the massively successful album/5(K). please buy Big Generator - you ll not regret it. am waiting now to re buy the remaster yes at a affordable price. enjoy x Read more. 6 people found this helpful.
