 · Here we are generating a random number in range 0 to some value. (In this program the max value is ). To perform this operation we are using the srand () function. This is in the C library. The function void srand (unsigned int seed) seeds the random number generator used by the function rand. The declaration of srand () is like below. i = rand (); The rand function generates an integer between 0 and RAND_MAX (a constant defined in the header). Standard C states that the value of RAND_MAX must be at least , which is the maximum value for a two-byte (i.e., bit) integer. In this C++ program, we generate N random numbers between 1 to using rand function. This program takes N as input from user and print N space separated random numbers on screen. The rand function of cstdlib standard library returns a pseudo-random number in the range of 0 to RAND_MAX, where RAND_MAX is a environment dependent value which is the Estimated Reading Time: 1 min.
