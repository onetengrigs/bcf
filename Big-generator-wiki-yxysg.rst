 · "BIG GENERATOR" is the 13th episode of Amnesia: Lost the Lights played by Markiplier. Welcome to Part 13 of my Let's Play of the Amnesia Custom Story: Lost the Light! This is a highly reviewed custom story with in gameplay and unique level design! I really like how the maker tried to get away from the typical dark castle interior! Enjoy!Length:  "Big Generator" (ビッグ・ジェネレイター, Biggu Jenereitā?) is a song by Yes that appears on their album, Big Generator. The second half of it was originally sung in the Japanese version of Gunnm by Gally in Bar New Kansas, but the lyrics were reworked for the English release by Viz Media, most likely.
