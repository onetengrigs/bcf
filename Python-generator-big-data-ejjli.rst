 · Generators don’t have to be complicated topics, they have a place in any Python programmer’s repertoire if given the time to be understood. Even in Big Data situations where simpler methods fall short, generator-based analyses still stand ted Reading Time: 8 mins.  · Python generators allow developers to lazily evaluate data. This is very helpful when you are dealing with so-called "big data". Their main use is for generating values and for doing so in an efficient manner. In this article, we will go over how to use a generator and take a look at generator expressions. To create a generator in Python, you use the keyword def just like when defining a function. In the generator, use the yield statement to return the elements instead of the return statement as usual. If a function contains at least one yield (can have multiple yield and add return) then this is definitely a generator g: big data.
