If you only look at the total watts, you might think you need at watt generator to power your home. But that's not really the case. Start appliances with high starting wattage requirements at different times. In our example, if you start the refrigerator and the furnace at separate times, you don't need watts of power - only lights:   · A generator is a first line of defense against these problems. But with models ranging from small recreational units that start at about $ and can power a single appliance to standby models. You can build a hand-crank generator as big as you like, but you won’t be able to actually crank out anywhere near enough power to run an average household. Not even if you are an elite athlete. Your best bet for human-powered electricity would be to connect a generator of some sort to a stationary bicycle.
