Generac home backup generators start at $1,—the most cost effective on the market. Installation costs vary by system size, installation considerations, and local building codes. We recommend you getting a free assessment from a Generac dealer near you. Before choosing a generator, the most important thing to consider is wattage. Small appliances, like coffee machines and light bulbs, don’t require as many watts as large appliances, such as space heaters and sump pumps. For tailgating, you might only need a generator with as little as to 1, watts. Save 2% instantly by using our convenient "e-check" option or by simply mailing us a paper check.
