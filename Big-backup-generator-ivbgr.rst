 · Understand How Backup Electric Generators are Rated. The next thing we need to understand when choosing a whole-house backup generator is how their power outputs are rated. Almost all standby generators and portable generators actually have two ratings: the running wattage and the surge wattage. Simply stated, the running wattage is the maximum. A Backup Generator Provides Power & Peace of Mind With power ranges from 8kW to over 50kW, a Honeywell backup generator will keep your most important electronics powered in any condition. Optional fuel types include Natural Gas, Propane, and Diesel powered generators. You might have to get an 18kW to a 24kW automatic home backup generator that is going to cost about $ or more. To this you have to add the cost of shipping, taxes, the transfer switch and installation. The installation costs alone could be at least $ or more.
