Mekanism Generators, Mekanism Fusion Reactors, and ExU Nether Star Generators (and maybe some of the generators in Reika's mods?) are the only generators that can match Big Reactors in terms of efficiency, ease of use, and power generation. If you're looking for some fun alternatives though, there's a bunch of options.  · Big Reactors come in two variants, Passive and Active. Passive reactors are simply stand alone power generators. They take Yellorium ingots as fuel (and also Uranium on some mod packs) and burn it to make energy. They can be sized to enormous proportions but the energy produced will always be a factor of the fuel it consumes. Extreme Reactors is the .  · Big Reactors emphasizes the construction of large machines out of multiple blocks, or “parts”.
