My club is the opposite. I think the biggest thing for time rush is having enough energy to play constantly for 45 minutes. My club has a VERY active coffee session at meeting time every day, I usually get energy just from that. Plus most of us save our star boosters and character cards for time rush. So I play Junes Journey without ever spending any real money. But I noticed that saving up with the in game currencies really is worth it. As I said in the title, for me saving up on diamonds iirc in order to buy the energy expansion pack, paid of really well.  · June’s Journey is a hidden object game set in the 's where your are tasked with finding certain items. You will receive points for each item found, and score multipliers for completing the task quickly. There is a hint feature to highlight items that you find difficult to see and in between many of the levels there are puzzles where you are required to assemble .
