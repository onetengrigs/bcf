How Does Our Band Name Generator Work? When you pick a genre, our app heads on over to a huge database of band and artist names, and randomly finds words that work well with the word (or words) you added.. It does this based on genre, so if you choose the ‘rock’ genre it will find combinations of words from bands or artists in that genre. Big Generator have always been regarded as somewhat of a benchmark of how a band should sound and perform in their native Ireland. From the beginning the band have always adopted a successful two strand approach playing a top quality covers set on one hand, while seperately writing, recording and releasing self penned material on the other. Big generator are a five-piece band based in the West of Ireland, in a town called Portumna, Co. Galway. Their name comes from the Yes album of the same title. They were formed by Liam Martin and Barry Conboy in October The other members of the band are Alan "Mack" McEvoy (drums and vocals), Dave Hockedy (vocals and guitar) and Paul Cantillon .
