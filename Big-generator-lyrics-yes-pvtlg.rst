Big generator Moving through the night Second nature sacrifice Even if you close your eyes We exist through this strange disguise I have heard it said to someone Maybe it was me There is a reason to experience Psychedelic so we could see To be growing up before us Like the black and white of love Be the focus, be the chorus Big generator. Big Generator - Wikipedia.  · Great song with lyrics.
