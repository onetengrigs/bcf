 · . # yep tesseracts are the way to go. im feeding multiple turbines from steam off my big reactor using just one tesseract on the reactor, and an input tesseract on each turbine set to same freq of reactor tesseract. also, feed the water from the turbines back to the reactor, they will keep the reactor stuffed with water once they. Every reactor build will be exactly the same. The only way something. Extreme Reactors is the original port of the mod Big Reactors, Modpack authors can use the Creative Water Generator / Steam Generator to create. The Big Reactors mod adds multi-block power systems capable of providing large amounts of RF power to Minecraft. A simlator for the Minecraft mod Big Reactors. Dimensions define the interior of the reactor (i.e., they exclude dimensions of the casing).
