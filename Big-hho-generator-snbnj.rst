The Brown gas generator uses electrolysis to split water (H2O) into it´s base molecules, 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen molecule. This is why it is often referred to as an HHO gas  HHO in itself is not an alternative to gasoline but a additive to boost the efficiency of the engine. Gasoline engines are unfortunately not burning gasoline to its full potential. A wide variety of large flame hho generator options are available to you, You can also choose from high safety level, large flame hho generator,As well as from manufacturing plant, energy & mining, and machinery repair shops. And whether large . HHO is a popular way of writing OxyHydrogen - a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases, usually in a ratio. Thus, HHO = Hydrogen-Hydrogen-Oxygen. Since the oxygen and hydrogen are in mixed gas mode and not bonded, it is not H2O (water). Bonding hydrogen and oxygen requires an ignition and chemical reaction.
