Delivery & Pickup Options - 74 reviews of Generator Dublin "This hostel is one of the best I've been to. It's been opened very recently, so everything is brand new, from showers to beds, which is really good for a hostel. We booked two beds in one beds dorm for 10€ per person and per night, with the bathroom outside. We were actually given 2 beds in one 6-beds ensuite room, 4/5(74). 2 days ago · View deals for Generator Dublin, including fully refundable rates with free cancellation. Families enjoy the breakfast.
