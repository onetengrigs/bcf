Yes Lyrics "Big Generator" [verse 1] Such a strange pre-occupation Such a strange peculiar breed How it's shining in its armour Made of gold and made of steel It can strike a chord inside you Like a generation's need Speaking happy words of promise [chorus 1:] Big generator Lives out of sight Big generator Hands upon the wheel Moving to the left. Yes – Big Generator Lyrics. from album: Big Generator () Verse 1: Such a strange pre-occupation Such a strange peculiar breed How it's shining in it's armour Made of gold and made of steel It can strike a chord inside you Like a generation's need Speaking happy words of promise Chorus 1. Big generator Lives out of sight Big generator Hands upon the wheel Moving to the left Movin' Moving to the right big generator moving through the night Second nature sacrifice Even if you close your eyes We exist through this strange disguise I have heard it said to someone Or maybe it was me There is a reason to experience.
