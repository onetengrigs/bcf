 · Big Generator was the first Yes album I owned, on cassette. Here, I’m reviewing the Atco CD. Big Generator does not start off strong. The first two songs on the first side are the weakest on the album, although each has its redeeming factors/5(78).  · Big Generator is a correct job that has more to do with hard rock than with the progressive world.3/5.  · The title song “Big Generator” follows with as a more standard rock song but with some added elements that make it unequivocally Yes. There are low key soundscapes during the verses, the orchestral-hit effects during the choruses, it also contains a very odd, short guitar lead which is almost out of tune with minimal backing s: 6.
